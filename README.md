# Admin panel/dashboard

This is a simple admin dashboard template made with flutter web, but the ios and android apps can easily be created with just some clicks with the same codebase!.
This project uses the GetX packages for flutter for a complete solution for navigation, http requests and state management, and it is responsive!
